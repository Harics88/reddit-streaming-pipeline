# Reddit Sentiment Analysis Data Pipeline
## Project Overview
The Reddit Sentiment Analysis Data Pipeline is designed to collect comments from Reddit using the Reddit API, process them using Apache Spark, store the processed data in Cassandra, and visualize sentiment scores of various subreddits in Grafana. The pipeline leverages containerization and utilizes a Kubernetes cluster for deployment, with infrastructure management handled by Terraform. Finally, Kafka is used as a message broker to provide low latency, scalability & availability.
